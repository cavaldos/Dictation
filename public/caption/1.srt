00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:00,934
Welcome guys.

2
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:04,404
Today we are learning real life

3
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:08,108
English around the house and the farm.

4
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,011
In this beginner friendly video, you will

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,613
follow me and my mom around as we teach you

6
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:15,348
beginner English naturally.

7
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:18,885
This video is part of my 3000 most common

8
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,520
English words series designed to help you

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,388
English words series designed to help you

10
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:26,593
understand 95% of English through comprehensible input.

11
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,863
Let's get the word count and let's go.

12
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:33,233
Okay, so now we're going to open the screen door.

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,935
I'm opening the screen door.

14
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:39,572
You can see there's a little latch here that you have to

15
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:43,376
push in and it unlocks the door.

16
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,912
And here right here on the

17
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:48,948
bottom part, this is a deadbolt lock.

18
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,418
So you can go like this and

19
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,920
turn it and it will lock as well.

20
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,823
I'm going to close the screen door again.

21
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,692
The screen door is to keep bugs outside but let air inside.

22
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,895
The screen door is to keep bugs outside but let air inside.

23
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,429
The screen door is to keep bugs outside but let air inside.

24
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,129
The screen door is to keep bugs outside but let air inside.

25
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,298
The screen door is to keep bugs outside but let air inside.

26
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,101
Now I'm going to put on my shoes.

27
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,371
These shoes are like a little bit weird.

28
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,374
I would call them sandals because they

29
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,242
don't have the back part of the shoe.

30
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,081
Anyways, now I'm putting my shoe on.

31
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,117
I'm lifting up this flap here and sliding my foot inside.

32
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,718
I'm lifting up this flap here and sliding my foot inside.

33
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,955
And I'm doing the same thing on the other shoe.

34
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,825
Now my shoes are on.

35
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,260
Here in Canada, for this

36
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,262
specific brand, we just call them Birks.

37
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:40,400
The brand, the name maybe in here you

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,769
can see a little bit, is Birkenstock.

39
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,070
That's the brand name.

40
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:45,472
I think it's from Germany.

41
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,142
So people in Canada just call them Birks.

42
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,610
Oh, I'm putting on my Birks.

43
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,579
So from now on, I'll just call them Birks.

44
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,181
I've got my Birks on.

45
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:56,950
You ready, Mom?

46
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,051
I'm ready, buddy.

47
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,153
Okay, let's go.

48
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,156
So we're on the patio right now.

49
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,391
And a patio is just an outdoor area,

50
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:09,896
usually made out of wood or this material.

51
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,631
This isn't wood, it's some sort of plastic.

52
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,968
But a patio area is just an area outside of your house,

53
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,469
usually right outside your back

54
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,304
door that you could come and

55
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,875
sit on or eat on or just relax on.

56
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:23,877
Okay, so here are my dogs.

57
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:25,979
Let's go for a walk.

58
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:26,513
All three of them.

59
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,749
And what are the cows doing here?

60
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,588
Well, it's been a dry summer and we had some grass here.

61
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:39,425
This is normally the chicken area

62
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,561
and we didn't have chickens this year.

63
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,430
So they ate the grass down.

64
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,066
And if you want, we could chase them back.

65
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:48,067
Okay.

66
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,269
Let's do it.

67
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,005
And you can see right here, this fence is

68
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,173
And you can see right here, this fence is

69
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:53,706
And you can see right here, this fence is

70
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:58,044
just a temporary fence because you can pick

71
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:58,845
it up and move it.

72
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,413
You can see it just slides in

73
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,715
here and also on the ground here.

74
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,951
So it's a temporary fence.

75
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,288
It's not in the ground, it's just on top of the ground.

76
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,624
So you can see right here, it just slides in.

77
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,227
So you can lift it out.

78
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,995
So it's just pieces.

79
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,630
Here's one piece.

80
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,366
Here is another piece.

81
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,169
I'll show you a permanent fence right now.

82
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:24,737
Come this way.

83
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,741
And this is what a permanent fence is.

84
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:32,345
You can see these posts are pounded into the ground.

85
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,783
Right there, right here, they're pounded into the ground.

86
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,886
This post is probably like that far

87
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:44,190
into the ground and there's also wire here.

88
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,260
You could have posts with wood or with wire, but a

89
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,062
permanent fence is a fence you can't

90
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,230
move easily.

91
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,902
If you open the gate, they'll just come and walk out and

92
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,737
then we'll open down there for

93
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:58,371
them.

94
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,039
Should we open down there first?

95
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:02,775
they'll go slow.

96
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,811
Just open this gate?

97
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:05,345
Yeah.

98
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,915
Okay, so this is a gate and

99
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,984
it's just like a pretty small gate.

100
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,719
It's just for people, but I guess

101
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,520
these cows can also fit through.

102
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,991
So this gate just opens by grabbing this

103
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:22,562
piece of metal and just sliding it upwards.

104
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,531
So there's no latch like that other door.

105
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,472
And now the cows are going to come out.

106
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,274
You can see the cows are very tame.

107
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,475
You can see the cows are very tame.

108
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,043
They're very tame.

109
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,044
They're not crazy.

110
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:39,512
They're not jumping around.

111
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,280
They're not trying to fight.

112
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,283
They're just tame and they just want to eat grass.

113
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,918
So it's nice.

114
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:48,955
The gray one?

115
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,526
Okay, I'm not sure which gate because my mom didn't really

116
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:57,397
tell me, but I'm going to assume

117
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:57,997
it's this gate.

118
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,099
Yeah, the gray one.

119
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,934
The gray one where Dexter is going in.

120
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,939
Okay, so I closed this gate and I

121
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,142
opened this gray gate right here.

122
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:15,515
This gate is bigger than that gate and this gate is gray.

123
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,619
That gate is kind of burgundy.

124
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,688
It's kind of faded a lot.

125
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:22,989
So you can come here.

126
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,126
You can see when it was brand

127
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,361
new, it was a lot more vibrant.

128
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,929
new, it was a lot more vibrant.

129
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,731
The color was a lot more vibrant,

130
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,933
but now the color is very faded.

131
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,068
It's faded.

132
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,170
And there's also rust.

133
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:38,438
There's rust.

134
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,172
It's faded.

135
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,740
It looks old.

136
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,411
Okay, let's go and go see where the cows went.

137
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:46,679
What?

138
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,181
I'm just on this side

139
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,415
I'm just going to walk them that way.

140
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,184
You could stay there, lovey.

141
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:52,051
Stay on the other side.

142
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,653
The cows are coming around the other side there.

143
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:57,790
Oh yeah.

144
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,227
You see there's a cow and a calf.

145
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,863
She's a runner, that one.

146
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:05,131
She's a runner.

147
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:05,998
She's a track star.

148
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,039
Do you want to go and round up that little calf there?

149
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,674
There's still another one.

150
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,009
Okay, there's another calf over

151
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,980
here that doesn't want to come out.

152
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,283
We have to go and chase him out.

153
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:24,817
We have to go and chase him out.

154
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:29,422
Go.

155
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:32,091
Go.

156
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,930
Okay, there you go.

157
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,603
Okay, I just closed the gate.

158
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,072
You go around that way.

159
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,340
Okay.

160
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,676
They know exactly where to go.

161
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,080
spoils them.

162
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,215
Okay, perfect.

163
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,888
You're going to give the dog a heart attack.

164
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:02,955
Why?

165
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,757
He's so old.

166
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,927
Yeah, I'm closing the gate with this chain.

167
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:10,196
Okay.

168
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,798
The cows are drinking water.

169
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,133
We're not milking tomorrow.

170
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:19,138
So they're going to hang out with their moms today.

171
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,773
So we can leave them here.

172
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,744
Or if you want, we'll just push them into the bush.

173
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:26,712
Just leave them.

174
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:27,847
Leave them here.

175
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:28,581
It's fine.

176
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,551
Okay, so this is a scratch pole.

177
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:37,824
It's almost like two broom heads and the cattle come and

178
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,892
they scratch their heads and their

179
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,261
back and their sides on this.

180
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,631
Yeah, they love scratching like this.

181
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,401
Scratching their backs and stuff with that.

182
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:55,708
Yeah, and we put oil in here so they get oiled.

183
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,910
It helps with keeping the flies off them.

184
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,879
It helps with keeping the flies off them.

185
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,012
It helps with keeping the flies off them.

186
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,180
Yep.

187
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,150
Okay, so we'll leave these girls here.

188
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,152
So what's the most important rule on a farm?

189
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,821
So what's the most important rule on a farm?

190
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,192
The most important rule is to always close the gates.

191
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,796
If you open a gate, always close it right away.

192
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,299
You open it, you close it.

193
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:20,500
Perfect.

194
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,001
And this, you can call this a pail.

195
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,603
And this, you can call this a pail.

196
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,339
This specifically is a five gallon pail.

197
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,274
But you can just call it a pail.

198
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,978
And you can put water in it or grain to feed the cows.

199
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,714
Did you want to feed the cows some grain?

200
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,450
I think they're good.

201
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,318
Okay, so perfect.

202
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:43,422
Let's go towards the fire pit area.

203
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,324
We can go and pull some carrots from my garden as well.

204
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,226
We can go and pull some carrots from my garden as well.

205
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,062
Yeah, let's go to the fire pit, then

206
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,531
the front yard and then the garden.

207
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,902
Yeah, hopefully it stays nicer for longer.

208
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,203
But I don't think so.

209
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,104
It's been pretty cold.

210
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,739
You know how it goes.

211
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,608
The weather can change here from one day to the next.

212
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,377
Oh yeah, it's unpredictable.

213
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,279
Very unpredictable.

214
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,514
Okay, now we're at the outdoor fire pit.

215
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,148
This right here is a fire pit.

216
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,150
This right here is a fire pit.

217
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,655
And you can see inside the fire pit, there's a lot of ash.

218
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,358
All of that is ash from wood.

219
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,260
Once wood burns, it turns into ash.

220
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,095
And this is called a poker stick

221
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,231
for the fire, to poke the fire.

222
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,734
This kind of outdoor building, you can call a gazebo.

223
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,271
And there are lights, light bulbs all

224
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,607
around the gazebo and a little bit inside.

225
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,011
And there's spider webs, I guess, on the gazebo too.

226
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,847
But let's go to the shop now.

227
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,251
Okay, and this is the shop.

228
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,485
I just opened the door.

229
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,658
This door has a small window on the top

230
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,561
part of the door, so you can see through.

231
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,731
But yeah, right now we're in the shop.

232
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,266
It's like pretty big.

233
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,500
The ceiling is very high.

234
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,970
You can see the ceiling is very high.

235
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,673
And I'm going to turn the lights on now.

236
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,276
So you can see all of this.

237
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:15,748
This is a lot of tools and like nuts and bolts and parts.

238
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:22,188
Yeah, it's a workbench and it is full of stuff because your

239
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,490
dad is working on his project.

240
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:30,296
So he's always looking for bits and pieces and screws and

241
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,466
nuts and bolts and you name it.

242
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,101
And these right here, this,

243
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,603
this, this, these are all aerosols.

244
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,205
this, this, these are all aerosols.

245
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,240
So these cans are aerosol cans also.

246
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,842
So these cans are aerosol cans also.

247
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:43,643
So these cans are aerosol cans also.

248
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:44,477
I can see.

249
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:45,077
Safety glasses.

250
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,679
Yeah, that's very important.

251
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,080
To protect your eyes.

252
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,149
It was broken?

253
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,417
Yeah, you can show that.

254
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,385
Oh, from there.

255
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:53,252
I made one.

256
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:53,986
Oh.

257
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,589
I made one for up there

258
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,124
To make it strong

259
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,726
I'm going to rockguard it at the back

260
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,129
Oh, rockguard the back of it.

261
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,930
So then it'll be strong like a

262
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,298
rock and then Polyurethane

263
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,133
So it's hard.

264
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,268
Oh, that looked good.

265
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,103
So i'm just waiting for the clips for that.

266
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,205
Okay, so Volka

267
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,040
Yeah.

268
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,876
Do you remember how to ride your unicycle?

269
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,280
Just straighten the seat out slightly.

270
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,014
It's slightly...

271
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,784
Do I remember how to ride it?

272
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:25,518
Yep.

273
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,387
Let's see if you can still do it.

274
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:29,455
The tire is inflated.

275
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,758
It is actually, i'm surprised.

276
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,929
So now the seat was not straight.

277
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,799
The seat was a little bit to the side on an angle.

278
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,701
So now I'm just putting the seat

279
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,668
straight in line with the tire.

280
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,103
straight in line with the tire.

281
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,007
Right there.

282
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,009
So this is a pedal.

283
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,245
Every bicycle needs to have a

284
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,146
pedal because that's how you pedal.

285
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,448
pedal because that's how you pedal.

286
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:56,348
So a pedal is the noun and to pedal is the verb.

287
00:11:56,348 --> 00:12:01,120
So a pedal is the noun and to pedal is the verb.

288
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,755
So I'm pedaling means I'm putting

289
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,923
So I'm pedaling means I'm putting

290
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,458
my feet on the pedals and I'm moving

291
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,193
and I'm going forward.

292
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:11,163
But I learned how to do this

293
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:14,600
many, many, many, many years ago.

294
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:15,468
Many years.

295
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,537
I think I was like how many years ago?

296
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,606
Probably like 10.

297
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,074
10, at least 10.

298
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:22,708
10 years ago.

299
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,376
And I haven't done it since.

300
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,545
So the last time I did this 10 years ago.

301
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:31,183
Wow.

302
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:37,923
Looks like you haven't forgotten how to ride the unicycle.

303
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,026
I guess not.

304
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,863
You used to ride it all the way up to

305
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:47,633
the driveway, to the road, on the gravel.

306
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:48,768
That would be harder.

307
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,485
You have to have good balance for that.

308
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:13,025
So like my mom just said, you have to have good balance.

309
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:13,959
So like my mom just said, you have to have good balance.

310
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,228
You have to have good balance.

311
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,164
If you don't have good balance, you're

312
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,967
going to fall because it's just one wheel.

313
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,939
That's why it's called a unicycle for one uni.

314
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,207
Where was this?

315
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,843
It's got a stand to the right hand side there.

316
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,012
This is the unicycle stand.

317
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,884
And if you come here, I already showed you guys this, the

318
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:41,320
lawn mower, the riding lawn mower.

319
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,389
But this right here is a dirt bike.

320
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,593
And this part of the dirt bike, so these are pegs.

321
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,096
But yeah, this is a dirt bike.

322
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,065
If you guys want to see me ride it

323
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,034
in a video, leave it in the comments.

324
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,503
Let's go.

325
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,573
Okay, I think, let's go to the garden.

326
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:01,974
Let's do that.

327
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:02,741
Let's go to the garden now.

328
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,643
What do we need at the garden?

329
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:05,644
Some carrots.

330
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,647
I am going to make some Thai

331
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,083
green curry with chicken tonight.

332
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,184
Thai green curry.

333
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,588
If you're from Thailand, write that in the comments.

334
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:20,125
Anyways, before we go there, let's pick some cherries.

335
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,127
You want to pick some cherries?

336
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:26,098
Just some for the road, not really too much.

337
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,733
I've picked the majority of them.

338
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,437
They're so good this year.

339
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,273
I know the cherries are really good.

340
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,542
Sometimes they can be a bit sour, but

341
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,611
oh, they're really delicious this year.

342
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:40,212
They're good.

343
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:46,218
So, we just picked some cherries.

344
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,922
We picked cherries past tense.

345
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,892
We're picking cherries present tense.

346
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,894
Future, we will pick cherries.

347
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:57,863
We're going to pick cherries.

348
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,599
What's your guys' favorite fruit to pick?

349
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,469
What's your favorite fruit to pick?

350
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,804
Leave it in the comments and make

351
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,973
a sentence with that word, to pick.

352
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,309
But right now we're in the garden.

353
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,214
Okay, so these, what are these, Mom?

354
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,049
These are raised beds.

355
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:24,590
They are waist-high, so that they are easy on my back.

356
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,260
Because normal gardens are like this on the ground, and you

357
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,629
have to go like this, or go like this.

358
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:34,366
And it can be hard on your knees and on your back, but with

359
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,835
this type of garden with a raised bed,

360
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:40,906
you could just reach over like this, standing up straight.

361
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,742
So you can garden while standing up straight.

362
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,078
And it's easier on your back.

363
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:46,979
So I'm just...

364
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,580
So now you're pulling carrots.

365
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:49,882
You want me to pull some too?

366
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,184
Yep, try to find the ones that look bigger.

367
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,419
Some of these are out of the ground.

368
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,788
I'll shove them back in.

369
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:57,756
They're not going to grow.

370
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,425
Your best just to pull them out.

371
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,360
Here, we can pull here on the edge.

372
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,495
Those two were out already.

373
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,801
How do you know if they're big or not though?

374
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,938
You see the stems, sometimes when I pull

375
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:16,442
them, the stems at the bottom are thicker.

376
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,878
And we have lots, so it doesn't matter

377
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,047
if there's a few that come out or not.

378
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,050
They are so good.

379
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,920
I picked one or two good ones there.

380
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:28,554
Perfect.

381
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,557
I accidentally pulled one small one though.

382
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,359
It's okay, we can eat it.

383
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,427
Give it a rinse and we'll eat it.

384
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:37,796
They're very good fresh.

385
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:38,764
How many do you want?

386
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,199
Oh, there you go.

387
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:40,933
You have a whole bunch.

388
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,134
That looks really good.

389
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,204
But if you pull them though, the thing is...

390
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,506
Yeah, the other ones come with them.

391
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,040
You gotta go...

392
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:48,974
You could break.

393
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,009
So if you pull it, they're so knotted up

394
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,611
So if you pull it, they're so knotted up

395
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,646
because you see they're all tied together.

396
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,815
So if I pull it, i'm going to pull out more.

397
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,018
So I'm going to break it here.

398
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:05,024
So now we have a bunch of carrots without pulling out more.

399
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,426
So put that back.

400
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,263
So this whole area here used to be a garden.

401
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,999
In the past, this was all a garden,

402
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,136
but my dad built these raised beds.

403
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,973
So we planted grass here and now

404
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,374
you can see just grass is growing.

405
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:24,710
Are you getting potatoes?

406
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:25,644
I'm so...

407
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:26,845
Is the one potato there?

408
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,581
So are these potato leaves poisonous?

409
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:31,550
Yes.

410
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,317
You can eat it

411
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,486
No, you can't eat potato leaves.

412
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,457
Okay, so these potatoes are different.

413
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,926
Can you give me three

414
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,796
differences between these two potatoes?

415
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,065
So the difference between these

416
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,201
two potatoes, the first is the color.

417
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,838
This is a red potato and this is a white potato.

418
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:56,508
The second difference is this one is round.

419
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,578
This one is longer and more oval shape.

420
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,880
And the final difference between these

421
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,515
two potatoes, can you guess what it is?

422
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:05,517
It's the taste.

423
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,154
These potatoes taste different.

424
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,256
So we have another one here.

425
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,591
What else do you need?

426
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,226
So what are you grabbing now?

427
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,262
I'm going to grab some of this basil.

428
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,867
Oh yeah, this basil smells strong.

429
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,436
The basil smells strong.

430
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,238
But it smells good.

431
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,306
It smells very good.

432
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:28,540
You put basil on food.

433
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,778
I didn't bring a container.

434
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,748
Well, we can wash the carrots and stuff outside as well.

435
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,485
Okay, and the final thing we're

436
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,086
getting from the garden

437
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,955
We are getting cucumbers.

438
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,325
And you can see, I don't know if you can see close up, but

439
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,926
there's a lot of these like prickly hairs on them.

440
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:53,031
But look at my dogs just chilling.

441
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:54,967
Isn't that right?

442
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,503
Oh, how are you doing buddy?

443
00:18:58,904 --> 00:18:59,905
And now he's stretching.

444
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,308
They're the best dogs.

445
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,645
They sleep during the day and they work during the night.

446
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:07,880
Yep.

447
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,550
So now I'm going to open up the well water.

448
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:17,256
This is a garden hose, or you can just call it a hose.

449
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:21,026
And now water is starting to flow out of the hose.

450
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,829
Water is flowing out of the hose.

451
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:29,001
And now I'm going to wash all of these with some water.

452
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,472
And the reason I call it well water is

453
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,173
because it comes from a well underground.

454
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,974
because it comes from a well underground.

455
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,576
So it comes from underground.

456
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,680
There's a well of water and this comes directly from there.

457
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,015
So it's cold.

458
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:47,786
It's very cold. Now I'm washing these carrots.

459
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,256
Ooh, that water is cold.

460
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,125
Okay, now I'm closing the water.

461
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,728
My leg kind of fell asleep.

462
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:02,000
So we have the pale, the silver pail, filled with

463
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,604
vegetables like carrots, cucumbers, potatoes.

464
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,374
And now I'm going to pick the pail up from the handle.

465
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:13,245
So this is the handle and I'm picking the pail up.

466
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,913
Well, I already picked it up.

467
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,014
Where are we going?

468
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,785
I think we leave that at the front door and then we go and

469
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,088
lock the gate and then we can go in and make supper.

470
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:24,289
Okay.

471
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:26,224
Where's the keys?

472
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,194
It should be in the bowl there.

473
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:32,030
Got it.

474
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,266
So these are keys.

475
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:39,338
This is a car key, but this is a gate key.

476
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,707
We're going to walk up the driveway to close the gate.

477
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,543
They'll be flying south now.

478
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,613
And you can see that that's a flock

479
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,348
of geese and they fly in a V shape.

480
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,216
of geese and they fly in a V shape.

481
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:56,922
So the geese are flying down south towards the United

482
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,424
States, even further south to Mexico

483
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,561
because right now it's almost fall in Canada.

484
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,696
And that's when it gets very cold.

485
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,201
So the geese and other birds fly south where it's warmer.

486
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:10,202
Okay.

487
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,471
And now we're closing the gate.

488
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:20,746
This gate is black and it pretty much just stops vehicles

489
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:24,016
from driving in through the driveway to our house.

490
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,917
So if you really wanted, you

491
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,719
could walk, but you can't drive.

492
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,588
And that's just for safety.

493
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,122
Okay.

494
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,124
We just locked the gate there.

495
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,960
You can see this row of trees right here.

496
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,530
How many years ago did we plant this row of trees?

497
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,166
Oh, that is a good question.

498
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:42,467
A lot, eh?

499
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,804
I think maybe 14 years ago.

500
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,555
The screen door is to keep bugs outside but let air inside.

501
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:04,089
The screen door is to keep bugs outside but let air inside.

502
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,059
The screen door is to keep bugs outside but let air inside.

503
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,761
I'm lifting up this flap here and sliding my foot inside.

504
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:11,963
That's the brand name.

505
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,067
Okay, so here are my dogs.

506
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,235
And you can see right here, this fence is

507
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,404
You can see the cows are very tame.

508
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,374
new, it was a lot more vibrant.

509
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,344
but now the color is very faded.

510
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,347
Do you want to go and round up that little calf there?

511
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,819
We have to go and chase him out.

512
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,222
It helps with keeping the flies off them.

513
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,893
So what's the most important rule on a farm?

514
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,964
And this, you can call this a pail.

515
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:48,967
Okay, now we're at the outdoor fire pit.

516
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,905
This kind of outdoor building, you can call a gazebo.

517
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,675
So these cans are aerosol cans also.

518
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,344
So now I'm just putting the seat

519
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,312
straight in line with the tire.

520
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,515
Every bicycle needs to have a

521
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,416
pedal because that's how you pedal.

522
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,518
So I'm pedaling means I'm putting

523
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,054
So like my mom just said, you have to have good balance.

524
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,524
But right now we're in the garden.

525
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,560
So if you pull it, they're so knotted up

526
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,596
because you see they're all tied together.

527
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,799
because it comes from a well underground.

528
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,170
And you can see that that's a flock

529
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,905
of geese and they fly in a V shape.

530
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,442
that's the end of the video, guys.

531
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,845
I'll be posting every single Friday from now on.

532
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,581
So make sure to turn on notifications and stay up to date.

533
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:40,619
And remember, guys, you will become fluent in English.

534
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,154
See you in the next video.
